# SmartSpaces

The home of the Smart Spaces API and runtime.

SmartSpaces is typically developed and run on Linux machines
such as a desktop, or a Raspberry Pi, but also should work easily on a Mac
under OSX.

The version of Linux or OSX does not matter, though SmartSpaces will only
run under a Java 8 JVM.

## Building from scratch

Build documentation is found in the BUILD.md file.
