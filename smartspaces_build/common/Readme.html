Smart Spaces
</h1>

<p>
Smart Spaces lets you create and run software which can control
a smart physical space.
</p>

<p>
An example of a smart physical 
space could be a room that recognizes when people enter it and where they
are and have the room respond in some way, for example speaking to
the people or turning on a light or having a soda get dispensed from
an automatic dispenser.
</p>

<p>
There are many examples available in the Workbench. 
See the documentation.
